    <h3>7. Risk Profiling Chemical Waste Shipments</h3>

    <p>You may encounter chemical waste many different circumstances. You may find it in or on:</p>

    <p><img class="kInteractive image image733" src="../imgs/G11_06.svg" style="margin: 5px; clear: none; float: right; position: static; transition: none; width: 45%;max-width: 200px;" /></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Containers</li>
        <li>Trucks</li>
        <li>Vehicles</li>
        <li>Vessels</li>
        <li>Aircraft</li>
        <li>Premises</li>
        <li>Factories</li>
        <li>Warehouses</li>
        <li>Recycling facilities</li>
        <li>Landfill</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now consider how many containers enter and leave your country every year? How many trucks cross your borders
        every day and how many warehouses are located in your cities? Trying to find smuggled chemical waste or other
        contraband amongst all of these circumstances is very difficult without some way to narrow your focus.</p>

    <p>To help you identify the potential movement of chemical waste it is important that you develop or utilise a risk
        management system. This system will help you identify shipments that pose a greater risk of having chemical
        waste through analysis of risk indicators. Examples of risk indicators include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Declared goods are not consistent with type of business of consignee/consignor</li>
        <li>High shipping costs for declared low value consignment <em>(shipment is not economically viable)</em></li>
        <li>Shipment is a heavier (or lighter) weight than is normal for the declared goods</li>
        <li>Description of goods on the shipping documents does not match Harmonized Systems (HS) code (<em>e.g. using
                HS code with lower rate of customs import duty</em>) or UN Code.</li>
        <li>Waste identity codes falsified.</li>
        <li>Declared goods are known to be used as cover materials for smuggled goods (<em>e.g. scrap plastic, tea,
                coffee beans, fish, handicrafts, etc.</em>)</li>
        <li>Incomplete/false company names/addresses.</li>
        <li>Fraudulent use of genuine company details.</li>
        <li>P.O Box or hotel/ suite/ apartment address is listed.</li>
        <li>Mobile phone number listed as contact point</li>
        <li>Loading/destination ports used should be consistent with consignor/consignee address</li>
        <li>Importer/exporter is recently established</li>
        <li>First time importing/ exporting</li>
        <li>Check for any known adverse compliance history (of any parties involved – importer, exporter, transporter,
            logging company)</li>
        <li>Storage method not consistent with waste type</li>
        <li>Intelligence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This list is not exhaustive; however, it represents a good starting point. If you detect one or more of these
        risk indicators you should consider undertaking an inspection or search.</p>
