    <h3>13. Financial Investigations</h3>

    <p>Suspects involved in transnational organised crime are engaged in criminal activity that requires the transfer
        of large sums of money to pay for criminal activities, the movement of smuggled contraband and corrupted
        officials. When you are investigating a smuggling chemical waste offence always ensure that you consider a
        parallel financial investigation for money laundering. These types of investigations can help you identify the
        those who benefit most from the smuggling of chemical waste.</p>

    <p>If you do not have the necessary skills to undertake these types of investigations speak with your supervisor or
        the relevant unit within your department. If you do not have this unit in your department speak with the
        relevant Financial Investigations Unit. Steps that you can take to collect evidence of money laundering can
        occur at different times within your investigation. These include:</p>
