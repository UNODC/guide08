    <h3>11. Chain of Custody</h3>

    <p>Chain of Custody refers to the chronological documentation and/or paper trail showing the seizure, custody,
        control, transfer, analysis and disposition of evidence. Because evidence can be used in court to convict
        someone of a crime, it must be handled in a careful manner to avoid allegations of tampering or misconduct
        which can potentially compromise a case.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for making a record of any chemical waste that comes into your possession and what you
        subsequently do with that evidence. If you hand it to another officer, or to an expert, or even back to the
        suspect you must make a record of this movement on a Chain of Custody form.</p>

    <p>There are many examples of Chain of Custody forms available on the internet, but you should first check whether
        your Department has its own form before using one of these.</p>

    <p>A chain of custody form should as a minimum include the following information about the evidence you have
        seized:</p>
