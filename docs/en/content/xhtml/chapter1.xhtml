    <h3>1. What is Chemical Waste</h3>

    <p>Hazardous waste is defined as a substance that poses a hazard to human health or the environment when not
        properly managed. A chemical waste is considered hazardous if it exhibits one or more of the following
        characteristics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ignitable</strong> – generally liquids with a flash point below 60°Celsius.</li>
        <li><strong>Corrosive</strong> – generally aqueous wastes with a pH or 2 or less or 12.5 or greater.</li>
        <li><strong>Reactive</strong> – are wastes that unstable, explosive and capable of detonation or reacting
            violently with water.</li>
        <li><strong>Toxic</strong> – a chemical that poses a hazard to health or the environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Hazardous chemical waste includes:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Chemicals that can no longer be used for their intended use (aged or surplus inventory).</li>
        <li>Mislabeled or unlabeled chemicals.</li>
        <li>Abandoned chemicals.</li>
        <li>Material in deteriorating or damaged containers.</li>
        <li>Residuals in chemical containers.</li>
        <li>Diluted solutions containing hazardous chemicals.</li>
        <li>Used photographic fixer and developer.</li>
        <li>Debris contaminated with a hazardous material (bio-waste, gels).</li>
        <li>Chemicals from e-waste</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Chemical waste can be both a liquid and a solid. It is important that we understand what constitutes chemical
        waste as you investigate these types of crimes. You should also be aware what constitutes chemical waste in
        your relevant legislation.</p>
