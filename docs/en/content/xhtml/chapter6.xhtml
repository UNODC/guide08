    <h3>6. The Internet and Smuggling Chemical Waste</h3>

    <p>The internet has revolutionised the way we live. As technology has developed so too has the way that criminals
        use this technology to facilitate their illegal activities. The advent of web-based encrypted communication
        applications, email, internet banking and the increased sophistication of mobile telephones have provided
        criminals with greater flexibility, security and reach.</p>

    <p>The smuggling of chemical waste involves the movements of huge quantities of waste from western countries to the
        Asia and Africa. Given this distances and networks involved much of the planning, logistics, reporting and
        payments are facilitated by the internet. This occurs on both the open and dark web. While we all know and have
        used the open internet, some of us may not be familiar with the dark web.</p>

    <p>The dark web is a collection of websites operating on an encrypted network with hidden IP addresses - all of
        which give users strong anonymity protection. Because they are not indexed by traditional search engines, you
        can only access them with special anonymity browser, such as I2P, Freenet, and the most common, The Onion
        Router (TOR) bundle.</p>

    <p>Several law enforcement and intelligence agencies have run successful major undercover operations targeting dark
        web users. If you believe that your chemical waste disposal case involves criminal activity on the dark deb
        then you should consult with the speciality unit within your department that addresses cybercrime, if one
        exists. These types of operations require specialist training and equipment.</p>

    <p>One area where you will find potentially valuable evidence and intelligence on chemical waste activities is
        through the analysis of suspects social media accounts. Social media offers law enforcement agencies the
        opportunity to gather intelligence on criminal networks and individuals involved in this crime. The ability to
        map their network of friends, images of their assets and notifications of where they are eating at restaurants,
        travelling on holidays, or meeting with friends may provide intelligence or investigative opportunities.
        Examples of social media sites include:</p>

    <p><img class="kInteractive image image733" src="../imgs/G11_06.svg" style="margin: 5px; clear: none; float: right; position: static; transition: none; width: 45%;max-width: 200px;" /></p>
  
    <ul>
        <li>Facebook</li>
        <li>Snapchat</li>
        <li>YouTube</li>
        <li>Twitter</li>
        <li>Instagram</li>
        <li>WeChat</li>
        <li>Zalo</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In some jurisdictions you may be able to approach the operators of Social Media platforms seeking user
        information, you should check what options are available to you in your country.</p>

    <p>While these platforms make it easier for criminals to carry on the activities, they also present opportunities
        for investigators. You can use them as possible entry points for undercover investigators and for collecting
        intelligence and potentially evidence. Never use your own account to communicate with suspects on any of these
        sites. You should create or utilise covert accounts for your communications.</p>

    <p>Should you communicate with suspects on these sites with a view to collecting evidence remember to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ensure that your actions are legal within your jurisdiction</li>
        <li>Ensure that you have sought the permission from your supervisor</li>
        <li>Always use a covert account</li>
        <li>Screenshot the suspects profile – this can be changed by them at a later date</li>
        <li>Screenshot any messages between you and the suspects</li>
        <li>Record any videos or messages they send to you</li>
        <li>If possible do not share your photograph with a suspect</li>
        <li>If possible do not post your photograph on your covert profile</li>
        <li>Refrain from talking via video with the suspect</li>
        <li>Ensure chain of custody of any evidence you collect (see chapter 12)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Another area where you may collect valuable intelligence or evidence are web-based communication applications.
        These systems offer end to end encryption between users which makes interception difficult. Examples of these
        types of platforms include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>WhatsApp</li>
        <li>Viber</li>
        <li>Line</li>
        <li>WeChat</li>
        <li>Telegram</li>
        <li>Wire</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The easiest way to collect evidence of a suspect’s criminality using these platforms (prior to arrest) is to
        connect and communicate directly with them in an undercover capacity. If you have the suspects phone in your
        possession than you can collect the digital evidence through the use of a cell phone analytical tool such as
        Cellbrite, or the physical recording of messages, photos, videos, call records or audio conversations.</p>
